Some useful features you can add to Tines. Feel free to modify
these for your own use, and contribute your own extras.

Files with a .rc extension are snippets you can add to your own
~/.tinesrc or other configuration file. You may need to modify
them for your own setup.

export_xslt.rc:
(new context) Prompts for a format and destination file. Tines
saves the current branch as an hnb file in /tmp/tines-tmp and
runs xsltproc on the branch. Two example XSLT files are included:

	hnb2md.xsl: converts the branch to Markdown format.
	hnb2ms.xsl: converts the brance to Groff -ms format.

You need to adjust the location of the XSLT files in the context
macros to point to their actual locations on your system before
using this context.
