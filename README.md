# tines
Tines is a console-based outliner/planner/notebook.
It is a fork of the hnb outliner,
which has not been updated in >10 years.

The current version, 1.9.19alpha, is based on hnb version 1.9.18pre7
and introduces support for 64-bit computers.
See the ROADMAP file for planned updates
along the way to version 2.0 and beyond.

The [wiki](https://github.com/larrykollar/tines/wiki) has a
fairly complete and updated set of documentation.
The doc directory provides manpages, sample files,
and general documentation.
