.SH NAME
tines_opml \- Interactions/conversions between Tines and OPML format
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Outline Processor Markup Language (OPML)
is a standard interchange format for outliners,
and will become the default format for Tines
in the near future
(the hnb format will be maintained as a legacy format).
This manpage describes how Tines maps
(and intends to map)
hnb and OPML elements and attributes.
.LP
Tines supports OPML 1.0.
Any OPML 2.0 elements and attributes
are silently ignored.
.
.SS OPML Head Element
The hnb format has no analogous section.
Tines and
.I hnb
silently discard any information
in the OPML <head> element on import.
.LP
On export, Tines and
.I hnb
write a placeholder <title> element.
.
.SS Attributes
Tines and
.I hnb
save OPML attributes on import,
and write them back on export.
The CLI commands
.BR att_get ,
.BR att_set ,
.BR att_clear ,
and
.BR att_list
can manipulate attributes if needed.
.LP
The OPML "text" attribute and the contents of an hnb <data> element
are equivalent.
The primary difference is that the OPML specification requires
the use of the "text" attribute in every <outline> element,
where hnb does not require the <data> element.
Thus, to avoid unexpected behavior,
Tines must insert a token text string when exporting blank entries.
.LP
hnb format has two attributes:
.TP 6
.I type
A freeform text attribute.
If set to "todo," Tines and
.I hnb
render the entry with a checkbox
(indicating the entry is a to-do item).
Tines also supports a value of "text"
to mark entries that should be rendered as body text on export.
.TP 6
.I done
When
.BR type= \[dq]todo\[dq],
this is the state of the item.
If
.BR done= \[dq]yes\[dq],
Tines and
.I hnb
render the entry with a checked checkbox.
Otherwise, the checkbox is blank.
.LP
In contrast, the OPML defines only the "type" attribute.
The specification
defers the implementation of "type" and its values
to the application.
.I hnb
simply imports and exports attributes to OPML verbatim.
As OPML has no
.B done
attribute, an exported OPML file may not validate properly.
.LP
Some OPML-based outliners define a "_note" attribute;
Tines preserves this information as well.
You can use the "att_get _note" CLI command
to display the value of this attribute
if it exists.
.LP
In Tines 2.0, all import/export actions
will be driven through XSLT stylesheets,
allowing the user to modify or extend conversions.
The planned attribute mapping is:
.TS
cb | cb s
cb | cb cb
l  | l  l .
